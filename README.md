How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

BY using Junit testing we can test each instance of our code step by step to ensure that it is working properly and with out error.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

We can interpret user needs by speaking with users directly and asking "what features do you value most from an app or program?" and then use that information to tailor the software to the users specifications. interpreting user needs correctly is important for many reasons, it saves time by not having to go back and add features that werent in the original design as well as saves money by not having to make the project take longer than expected.


How do I approach designing software?

As I am still very new to desiging software I tend to try and gather as much information from theclient as possble and then design as close to that as I possibly can.
